  diagram is a tool for manipulating PNG images using imagemagick and
  the Go image library

** Dependencies
   - [[https://golang.org/][Go]]
   - [[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]] with Pango support
     - on Arch Pango is an optional dependency of ImageMagick, so make
       sure you also have that installed for creating labels
   - [[https://elm-lang.org/][elm]]

   ```
   $ diagram [-grid h,v] captions image
   ```

   Will put the captions in the `captions` file onto the PNG image
   `image`. The format of the caption file is

   ```
   Text Size  xpos,ypos
   ```

   Where `Text` is a single "word" (no spaces allowed), `Size` is an
   integer points for the font size, and `xpos,ypos` is a comma-separated
   pair denoting the x- and y-position of the label. The `-grid` flag
   takes a comma-separated pair of integers denoting the number of
   `h`orizontal and `v`ertical gridlines to draw.
